			<h1>What is SIP</h1>
			
			<h2>SYSTEMATIC INVESTMENT PLAN(SIP)</h2>
			
			<p>Systematic Investment Plan- When an investor choose a fixed amount (to be invested every month) in a certain fund (or a group of funds) that is called SIP. Hence, SIP is not an investment, it’s a mode of investment. SIP is a smart & hassle-free mechanism for investing in Mutual Funds.
			SIP is a great enabler. It disciplines investors to invest a fixed, pre-determined amount. With a planned approach towards investments, SIP not only helps you build wealth but also instills the habit of savings. In short, SIP is a simple and smart way of investing in mutual funds. Minimizing risk and creating wealth.
			How Does SIP Work?</p>
			<p>When you start a SIP investment, your money is invested into a specific mutual fund scheme (decided by you) and gets auto-debited from your bank account. In return for that investment, a certain number of units are allotted to the SIP investor. A number of units are based on the current market rate (known as the net asset value or NAV) on the date of the investment.</p>
			
			<p>Additional units of the mutual fund scheme are purchased at market rate each time a debit takes place from your account. The units so purchased are added to your account (commonly known as client folio number or account number). This is where SIP is magical. It enables investors to buy at all market levels hence averaging smartly. This is exactly why SIP has gained prominence the world over. As it helps in rupee cost averaging. If the markets are down a SIP investor automatically ends up buying more units and vice versa. This feature of SIP creates exceptional wealth in the long run. In fact, steeper the downturn, better are the returns. Though Simple, but SIP is a very powerful concept.<p>
